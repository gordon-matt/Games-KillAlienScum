# Kill Alien Scum!

## About
I created this game a few years ago while studying a course from Harvard X called, [CS50's Introduction to Game Development](https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50s-introduction-game-development?delta=0).

It was my final project for the course. I had intended to polish it off some more before making it public, but never got around to it. So I'm just making it public now anyway.

Here's the video I submitted for this final project, which explains some of the design and demonstrates the game in action:
